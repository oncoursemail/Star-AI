"""Opt-in skill-pack routing by embedding similarity (setting `skill_pack_embeddings`).

The keyword router (`star.skill_packs.select`) needs the prompt to name a pack's topic in its trigger words. When
it finds nothing, this router embeds the prompt with STAR's own embedding model (star-embed-ft1 on STAR Server) and
picks the pack whose name and description are closest, above a similarity floor. The same context rules apply (a
Roblox, Godot or named-engine prompt, only enabled packs), so unrelated prompts stay unchanged. Pack vectors are
cached on disk per model and pack text. Any problem (server unreachable, slow, odd reply) gives the keyword answer.

Why keyword first: on the 197 held-out routing cases of the pack tests the embedding router alone was right 171
times at this floor and the keyword router 197; on 36 requests that describe a topic without its trigger words the
keyword router was right 16 times and keyword-then-embedding 25 (benchmarks/skill_pack_routing.py). MIN_SIMILARITY
was set before that measurement and not tuned on it.
Idea from jcode's embedding-matched skills (github.com/1jehuang/jcode, MIT); no code was copied.
